# django_project1
This is some of the code from the Traversy Media Django course on Udemey. It's a great course where you build a real estate
website with tons of functionality using django. I don't plan on finishing it, I just needed to better understand some aspects
of getting python on the web and this course has helped get me where I want to be. I highly recommend it or anything from 
Traversy Media.
